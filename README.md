# Complex-Matrix-Program-for-TI84-Plus-CE
# IMPORTANT
You need to upgrade your calculator OS to atleast version 5.2
## How It Works
Basically automates the following process in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVB3_ANZDGQ)
Credit to MoVoltage MoPower for the video\
You simply enter the complete value WITH it's imaginary parts and real parts and the program will automatically create the matrix in the video above and perform the necessary operations.\
It will also neatly spit out only the necessary information you need from the matrix, so you don't need to search through the matrix.\
Has an easy to understand interface.
## How do I get this program onto my calculator and run it?
1. Install TI Connect
2. Upgrade your calculator(if your OS is under 5.2)
3. Download the iMatrix file
4. Connect Calculator to your computer
5. Open TI Connect and click on the middle botton on the left hand side(icon look like a stack of papers)
6. Click on the computer icon that has an arrow going up and to the left.
7. Locate and open the IMATRIX.8xp
8. On your calculator, click on the prgm button and EXEC the program
## Notes
1. The top value of the inputs is the left most position of the Matrix
2. The generated Matrix is saved to Matrix [I]
3. The answers are saved to the list L3.
4. Haven't done a thorough test yet. If you find any bugs, create an issue.
# If you have a suggestion, send me a message and I'll try to implement it in a future update.
